___ Installing ___

1.  Extract the files from this .zip file using your favorite zip 
program (you should have already gotten that far or you wouldn't be 
reading this).

2.  The screensavers are the files that end with ".scr".  Move or copy the
screensaver files to the C:\Windows\System32\ directory.  (You may notice
that this directory contains other screensavers that come with Windows.)

3.  Double click oalinst.exe to install OpenAL.  Skyrocket uses sound and will
not work without OpenAL.  The version of OpenAL that was distributed with
previous versions of Skyrocket is extremely old and will not work with
Skyrocket version 4.0.

4.  Right-click on your desktop background and click on Display Properties.
Click on the Screen Saver tab.  Select a screensaver from the list.

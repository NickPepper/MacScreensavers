Compiling notes:

Version 0.2 - The current project files for Visual Studio 2008 (9) Express
Edition are up to date.

Version 0.1 - Project files for Visual Studio .NET 2003 were used for verion
0.1 were used, but they are no longer maintain.  They are missing a project
file for Microcosm and other updates.

There are bits of X Windowing System (X11) code among the rssavers source code.
However, the code in this project has never been fully converted to work as
*nix screensavers.  Hyperspace and Microcosm were actually written in Linux
originally and then ported to Windows.  This is because gdb and ddd tend to work
much better than the Visual Studio debuggers and because Microcosm required
much performance profiling with gprof, which cannot be done with the Express
Edition of Visual Studio.  Perhaps the paid versions of VS have decent
profilers.


Distribution notes:

NullSoft Installer is used to build bin/installer.nsi.

bin/GPL.txt and bin/README.txt do not appear to maintain their DOS-style
carriage returns when stored in svn.  They must be repaired with unix2dos
before being distributed.
